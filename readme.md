### Assessment Task Summary

To complete this assessment task, follow the steps outlined in the article "Convolutional Neural Networks: A Python Tutorial Using TensorFlow and Keras" by Luciano. The task involves creating an image classifier to identify whether an image contains a dog or a cat. Use the provided codes and dataset to execute and analyze the following sections from the article:

1. **Loading and Pre-processing Our Image Data with NumPy**
2. **Training Our Neural Networks**
3. **Training a Convolutional Neural Network**
4. **Neural Network with Two Convolutional Layers**
5. **Even Bigger Convolutional Neural Network**

#### Requirements:
- Implement the code in Python, ensuring it is well-formatted and follows Python naming conventions.
- Add sufficient comments in your own words to explain the code.
- Describe all the steps in a 1,000-word report, highlighting deep-learning principles and how convolutional neural networks helped achieve the expected results.
- Include a cover page, table of contents, and page numbers in your report.
- Provide a concise summary, articulate relevant deep-learning principles, and discuss any limitations.
- Articulate relevant deep-learning principles and necessary methods.
- Highlight how convolutional neural networks worked to produce the expected result despite possible limitations.
- Present your report using any standard writing format.
- Include a cover page and table of contents.
- The cover page must include your official student name and number. A word count should be stated at the end of the report (before the reference section).
- Page numbers are required. The page number should appear in the footer together with your student identification number.
- All figures and tables should have meaningful captions.

#### Assessment Criteria:
- Completeness and efficiency of the implementation.
- Coding convention and quality of the code.
- Articulation of the outcomes in relation to the theories from class.- Submit the source codes and the written report, including instructions on how to run your code at the top of your main source code file inside a comment block.

#### Report Guidelines:
- Prepare a 1,000-word report clearly articulating the entire process of your project implementation and outcomes.
- Provide a concise summary highlighting the project statement, aim, and any possible research questions.
