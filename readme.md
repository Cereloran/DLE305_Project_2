# DLE305 Assessment 3 Summary

### Objective
Enhance the existing image classifier from Assessment 2 to recognize lions and tigers in addition to cats and dogs.
<br>
<br>
### Instructions
1. **Start from Assessment 2 Implementation:**
   - Use the pre-trained model from Assessment 2.
<br>
<br>
2. **Enhance the Image Classifier:**
   - Enable the model to recognize lions and tigers.
   - Use appropriate techniques (e.g., retraining with more data, transfer learning, regularization).
<br>
<br>
3. **Demonstrate and Explain Enhancements:**
   - Show how the enhanced classifier is achieved using the pre-trained model.
   - Discuss the extent to which the new model meets the objective.
   - Highlight any issues (e.g., overfitting) and provide insights.
<br>
<br>
4. **Report Requirements:**
   - 1,500-word document.
   - Include a short introduction, deep-learning principles, and detailed steps of the enhancement.
   - Cover page with student names, numbers, group ID, and word count.
   - Table of contents, page numbers, meaningful captions for figures and tables.
   - Standard writing format.
<br>
<br>
5. **Presentation Requirements:**
   - 10-minute audio-visual presentation.
   - Title slide with student and subject details.
   - Summarize research, engaging and informative.
   - Consistent layout/text sizes and style.
   - PDF format for slides.
   - Equal presentation time for all students.
   - Practise beforehand for clarity and conciseness.
   - Include correct reference lists if required.
<br>
